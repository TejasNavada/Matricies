# Matricies

I wanted to make a project that was related to what I was learning in linear algebra because whilst learning I felt a lot of these operations would be easily automated and because I have heard that vector and matrix math is very important in ai/ml fields.

Step 1: First thing I did was create an initial UML diagram to give myself a framework to work off of.

Step 2:  When I started coding I realized it would be easier if I made another class matrix to encapsulate a lot of the matrix actions.

Step 3: Continued with the coding and found that the eigenValues and eigenVectors and isDiagonizable functions seem very hard or impossible to implement. For the time being decided to scrap them.

Steps Forward: Next find out how to implement the eigenvalues and eigenVector functions then using those implement isDiagonizable and further optimize power function with A^n = P(D^n)(P^-1)
